        <code>GDK Demo</code> is a collection of sample programs and example code, and other utility class libraries,
        for Google Glass Development Kit (GDK).
        Please check out the project on GitHub:

          <h3>Glass Development Kit Playground</h3>
          <p>
          <code>GDK Demo</code> is GDK playground for Android/Glassware developers.
          It includes a variety of sample codes using GDK (or, just plain Android API),
          which can be quickly built/run to test certain API features or 
          just to get access to some working example apps.
          All the code samples in the <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo">GDKDemo</a> site 
          is released under an open-source license, <a href="http://www.noevils.org/licenses/donoevil-1.0.html">DNE-1.0</a>.
          
          </p>

          <h3>Building and Running the GDK Sample Apps</h3>
          <p>
          Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo">GitHub GDK Demo site</a>
          for dev-related information.
          The projects include gradle build scripts and should be buildable as is.
          You can easily import the projects to an IDE such as Android Studio as well.

          </p>

          <h3>Glassware Developer Diary</h3>
          <p>
          I have a personal blog, <a href="http://blog.glassdiary.com/">Glass Diary</a>,
          on which I keep my daily journal.
          I originally started this blog to write the Glass-related news, or my views on Google Glass or other wearables.
          Recently, however, I've been using this site more to write "how-to" docs related to 
          Android or Glassware development, or just dev topics in general.
          I typically write about the GDK sample projects when I release them to GitHub.
          Please check it out, if you need more info on any of the GDK sample apps mentioned on this page.

          </p>

          <h3>GDK Tutorials and Samples</h3>
          <p>
          The GDK Demo repository will be used for
          hosting source code for Google Glass development tutorials
          and other "sample Glassware".
          <i>Coming soon..._</i>

          <h3>GDK Live Card Example</h3>
          <p>
          Google Glass Development Kit is a "variation" of the standard Android SDK.
          There are a few new features in GDK that are specific to Google Glass,
          including the voice trigger, and Glass-specific touch gesture inputs, etc.
          In my view, the <a href="">Live Card</a> is one of the most important features in GDK.
          <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo/tree/master/apidemo">LiveCard Demo apps</a> on GitHub
          demonstate basic usages of the LiveCard API.

          </p>

          <h3>GDK Touch Gesture Example</h3>
          <p>
          Google Glass includes a touch pad, but no touch screen.
          GDK `GestureDetector` (similar to its Android counterpart)
          provides a high-level gesture API (as opposed to having to deal with the low-level touch events directly).
          The <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo/tree/master/apidemo/gesturedemo">Gesture Demo app</a> 
          is based on the GDK doc sample code, and 
          it shows how to handle the Glass gesture events.
          
          </p>

          <h3>GDK Voice Input Example</h3>
          <p>
          Google GDK, or the current "Sneak Peek" version, includes two types of supports for voice inputs.
          One is used to start a Glassware on your Glass.
          It is called "Voice Trigger", and it can be easily enabled 
          simply changing some configurations or resource files.
          The second prong of the GDK voice input API is the speech recognition,
          which is not specific to GDK, but is more valuable on devices like Google Glass.
          The <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo/tree/master/apidemo/voicedemo">Voice Demo app</a>
          demonstrates the use of these two types of voice API.

          </p>

          <h3>Glassware API Sample Apps</h3>
          <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/harrywye/gdkdemo">The GDK Demo repository</a> contains
          further sample apps illustraing various features of GDK
          (or, Android APIs as used on Google Glass),
          including the use of camera and sensors on Glass, etc.
